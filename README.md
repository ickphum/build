# build
3D building program featuring geometric shapes. 

I'd tried creating a 3D building program before based on the standard 4-pane 
X/Y/Z/Perspective layout, but found them cumbersome to use for casual work.

The interface I created here was based on a demo reel for a game I saw; there's
a movable ground plane on which the user drags out first the object's footprint
and then its height. Following this, any adjustments to the object can then be
made, such as changing the curve of an arch, the number of steps in a stairway
and so forth.

Perl + WxWidgets + OpenGL
